This branch is for the beginning. I realised that I need to practice from the beginning other than the targetted study plans.
Hence here I go in the decreasing order of acceptance rate problems. Usually Algorithms but also whatever else that makes me keep trying/keeps me motivated.
Mostly as a buffer for when I need a break from study plans but not regress in skill.
