This branch is for the beginning. I realised that I need to practice from the beginning other than the targetted study plans.
Hence here I go in the decreasing order of acceptance rate problems. Usually Algorithms but also whatever else that makes me keep trying/keeps me motivated.
Mostly as a buffer for when I need a break from study plans but not regress in skill.

Also, will attempt the next day, or current day's themed easy problems. For Example, if the next day for my study plan is depth first search, I can do other Depth Search
based algorithms to practice it.
