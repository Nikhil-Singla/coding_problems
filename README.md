> A log of 300+ algorithmic problems, solved in Python and C++.
Built to demonstrate my strong core CS concepts, through real-world coding drills and practices.

## Overview

This repository documents my structured, problem solving journey, covering classic topics like Dynamic Programming, Trees, Graphs, and Greedy Algorithms. 
Each problem includes not only my attempt of the solutions in Python or C++, but also optimizations that I have learnt with patterns and strategies emphasized.
