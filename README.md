Its Problem Solving :D

Multiple tries; Commits to GitHub only when there's a qualitative change in the code

Disclaimer: 
All the code is only tailored to the competition/problem and serves to demonstrate understanding, and is in no way exhaustive of the real world scenarios. 
There are many ways to bypass security and act in bad faith by actors looking to exploit vulnerabilites.
This is also not indicative of the "optimal" or the "complete" answer to the presented problem, but only code that behaves within the constraints of the competition.
